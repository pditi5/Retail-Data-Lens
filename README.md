# Retail-Data-Lens

This project analyzes retail transaction data to uncover valuable insights about our top-performing products and the characteristics of our most loyal customers.  By understanding these patterns, we can optimize our marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer relationship management to drive growth and profitability.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on identifying:

*   The top 3 most profitable products.
*   The demographic profile of our most loyal customers.
*   Product preferences of loyal customer segments.

The project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:

*   `purchase.csv`: Contains customer demographics (LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER).
*   `transaction.csv`: Contains transaction details (DATE, STORE_NBR, LYLTY_CARD_NBR, TXN_ID, PROD_NBR, PROD_NAME, PROD_QTY, TOT_SALES).

*(Note: You should replace this with the actual source of your data if it's different.)*

## Code

The Python code for this analysis is located in `retail-data-lens.ipynb`.  The notebook includes data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results.

## Key Findings

*   **Product Champions âœ¨:** *Dorito Corn Chp Supreme*, *Smiths Crnkle Chip Orgnl*, and *Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar* are our profit powerhouses ðŸ’°.
*   **Family Loyalty ðŸ’–:** "OLDER FAMILIES" (Budget segment) are our loyalty linchpins ðŸ”—.
